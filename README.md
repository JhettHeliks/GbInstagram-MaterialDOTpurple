# GBinsta Theme
***
This is just a simple (Or somewhat simple ðŸ˜†. I'm hoping this will help) theme for Gbinsta apk. This is of course editable if you know XML. But it can also be more easily edited in the app itself (I suggest editing in the app. I will tell you how in the "More Section" of this tutorial.). 
***
* Ok so first you need to download the XML file by just clicking on the big green download button A. Then when you do just save it. 

* * _**If you don't want to allow the installation of unknown sources (Apps) then STAWP âœ‹ here .**_

* It is best if you uninstall the original Instagram app so you don't have duplicates.

* To load the theme you need to open GBinsta go to you profile and there should be two gears at the top right of the screen.

* Now you should be in the GBsettings. This is where all the settings for themeing and other things will be. We are more interested in the themeing part though. To load a theme you need to click on "More" option under the "Themes" section of the settings.

* At this point you should have downloaded the XML file on this repository and saved it to your phone.
